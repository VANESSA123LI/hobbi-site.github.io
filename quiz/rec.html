    <p class="rec" class="rec-desc"> I'm sorry that you have not been feeling well. You might be interested in visiting the NAMI organization. NAMI is the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the nationâ€™s largest grassroots mental health organization dedicated to building better lives for the millions of Americans affected by mental illness. 
      
    NAMI started as a small group of families gathered around a kitchen table in 1979 has blossomed into the nation's leading voice on mental health. Today, we are an association of more than 500 local affiliates who work in your community to raise awareness and provide support and education that was not previously available to those in need. NAMI works to educate, advocate, listen and lead to improve the lives of people with mental illness and their loved ones. Learn more at nami.org!
